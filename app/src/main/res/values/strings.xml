However, to ease with the chatting process, you are asked to select a nickname. You will own the nickname as long as you don\'t dump your account. If you dump your account, you cannot use the nickname again. A lot of features are yet to come like image and gif sharing. The app is kind of in a beta phase. Be on a look out for updates.</string>
